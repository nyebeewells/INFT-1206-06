2 types of images, raster and vector images

in raster- shows exactly where pixel was placed and what exact colour
Bitmap(.bmp),PNG(.png), JPEG(.jpeg) & GIF(.gif)

vectors use an algorythm, given a shape and path defintions so that it can be remade everytime
SVG(.svg)

when viewed in small size raster and vector look the same, however close up raster looks blurry and vector stays as straight loine.
vector uses more processing but less memory, raster uses less processing but more memory


what is svg
its an XML-based language for describing
vector images.

markup, like HTML, except that
you've got many different elements for defining
the shapes you want to appear in your image,
and the effects you want to apply to those
shapes.

example of XML code
ex1
<svg
version="1.1“
baseProfile="full"
width="300"
height="200"
xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg
>
<rect width="100%" height="100%"
fill="black" />
<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="90" fill="blue" />
</svg> 
ex2
<img
src="equilateral.svg"
alt="triangle with all three sides equal"
height="87"
width="100" />


responsive images.
- images that work well on a mix of screens sizes and resolutions.
- issues when try to view on narrow screen

solution to details being lost on smaller screens is to prepare 
smaller, cropped images for different sized screens

►A small raster image starts to look grainy when
displayed larger than its original size.
►Solution: multiple resolutions would be made
available to the user's web browser. The
browser could then determine the optimal
resolution to load based on the screen size of
the user's device. 

Responsive image technologies were
implemented recently to solve the problems
indicated above by letting you offer the browser
several image files, either all showing the same
thing but containing different numbers of pixels
(resolution switching), or different images
suitable for different space allocations (art
direction).

<img
srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
800px"
src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

<!--

► srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose
between, and what size each image is.
► sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and
indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain
media conditions are true
► Media condition ((max-width:600px)): describes a possible state that the
screen can be in i.e when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less

for old browsers allow to use original image regardless w/ <src></src>
-->

<img
srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-
480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

<!--
You can allow the browser to choose an
appropriate resolution image by
using srcset with x-descriptors and without sizes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Art direction problem involves wanting to
change the image displayed to suit different
image display sizes
